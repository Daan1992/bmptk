//! \mainpage
//!
//! bmptk is a C++ library and build tool for bare-metal use on 32-bit 
//! embedded systems. 
//! Bare-metal refers to the situation that there is only the application. 
//! The application has full control of the hardware, and is running 
//! without the support of a separate operating system. 
//! Operating system functionality can still be present, but must be in the 
//! form of libraries, which are statically linked into the application.
