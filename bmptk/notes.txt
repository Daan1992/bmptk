A global object must never depend on another global object
Better: do not use global objects!


PSPad

- make entries in the ppr file for compile (=build), run and clear
- build.bat, because it must be a command?
- the open file must be in the project directory!!
- tabs :(
- open a second PSPad gives bizarre error messages
- the PSPad file list is NOT used (the makefile rules)
- on win7/64 the edit tabs do no show the file names..
- the start dir for file open is the last used (can be by the previous PSPad)
- edit Makefile: right-click, 'open as text'
- :) "" and '' handling, or is that my PC?
