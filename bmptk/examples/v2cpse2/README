Bare Metal Programming Tool Kit V2CSPSE1 examples directory

This part of the tree contains code that is used in the 
assembler course I give at the Hogeschool Utrecht, the Netherlands.
All code uses the DB013 board, which contains an LPC1114 chip.


This directory contains :
   Makefile : supports 'clean' and 'build' targets
   README   : this file

subdirectories 
   tasks    : shows how to do basic task switching
